# Sundown Engine


An extendible WebGPU game and simulation engine for fun, games and research


### Installation


Make sure you have the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Clone this repository and make sure to `npm install` to get all the package dependencies.


```bash
> git clone git@github.com:Sunset-Studio/Sundown.git
> cd Sundown
> npm install
```

### Running


With the project cloned and all package dependencies installed, you're ready to run the project. There is an example **app.js** that is included from the top-level **index.html** file. Feel free to replace this with your own experiments or entry points.


To run the development project in a browser, use the npm `dev` command
```bash
> npm run dev
```


To run the development project in an electron instance, use the npm `devtop` command
```bash
> npm run devtop
```


### Packaging


You can package and distribute builds for the web or for desktop with the help of [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).


To package for the web, just run the npm `build` command.
```bash
> npm run build
```


Then copy the resulting **index.html** file and **assets** and **engine** directories into your site's root.


To build executable electron packages, use the provided npm `make` command. This will create executable outputs in a top level *executables* directory.
```bash
> npm run make
```
