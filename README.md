# Sundown Engine 🕹️

An extendible WebGPU game and simulation engine for fun, games and research.

![Sundown Demo](./sundown_demo.gif)

Some of the current (code) features include:

* ⚡ WebGPU renderable abstractions
* ⚡ Flexible render graph for crafting render and compute pipelines
* ⚡ Simple, expressive material system for crafting custom shaders and materials
* ⚡ Gameplay simulation layer system for adding layered, modular functionality
* ⚡ ECS system for more efficient processing, using a fragment framework and TypedArrays where possible
* ⚡ Simple, context-based input system, allowing you to set up different input schemes and contexts
* ⚡ Built-in PBR shaders
* ⚡ Entity-first instancing
* ⚡ Auto instancing and draw batching of meshes using a specialized mesh task queue
* ⚡ Compute task queue for easily submitting compute shader work
* ⚡ MSDF text rendering
* ⚡ Configurable post-process stack
* ⚡ Immediate mode screen-space UI
* ⚡ Helpers for loading GTLFs, tracking performance scopes, named IDs, running frames and more.

Sundown also includes a simple but capable ML framework for running real-time AI experiments:
* ⚡ Simple gradient tape for backprop based learning
* ⚡ High-level, layer-based DAG subnet API for composing models from smaller subnetworks
* ⚡ Expanding library of activation functions, loss functions, optimizers and configurable layers
* ⚡ MasterMind class for orchestrating weight sharing, adaptation and real-time retraining of multiple models

### Installation


Make sure you have the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Clone this repository and make sure to `npm install` to get all the package dependencies.


```bash
> git clone git@github.com:Sunset-Studio/Sundown.git
> cd Sundown
> npm install
```

### Running


With the project cloned and all package dependencies installed, you're ready to run the project. There is an example **app.js** that is included from the top-level **index.html** file. Feel free to replace this with your own experiments or entry points.


To run the development project in a browser, use the npm `dev` command
```bash
> npm run dev
```


To run the development project in an electron instance, use the npm `devtop` command
```bash
> npm run devtop
```


### Packaging


You can package and distribute builds for the web or for desktop with the help of [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).


To package for the web, just run the npm `build` command.
```bash
> npm run build
```


Then copy the resulting **index.html** file and **assets** and **engine** directories into your site's root.


To build executable electron packages, use the provided npm `make` command. This will create executable outputs in a top level *executables* directory.
```bash
> npm run make
```


### Contributing


Sundown is available for free under the MIT license. You can use and modify the engine for individual or commercial use (a reference or mention is still appreciated!)
